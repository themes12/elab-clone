Required software
-----------------
* To build the box, the 32-bit libraries are required:
    * sudo apt-get install g++-multilib


C# support
----------

One requirement to run mono that we can't find a way to get around it
is that the user must have a valid writable home directory.  The mono
system will write a temp file in ~/.wapi/.  Thus, the box user must
have valid dir.


Java support
------------

Currently there seems to be some problem with Sun java 6 when running
under box as a different user with set-uid bit on.  The JVM complains
that it can't find the required shared library.  Running under normal
box works fine.

The current box cannot kill java submission.  Another script that
kills an instance of box is required.
