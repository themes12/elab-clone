Upgrade notes
=============

Python 2 -> 3
-------------
* print function
* Exception syntax
* Floating-point division instead of integer
* All Python3 strings are unicode
* Octal literals must now be prefixed with 0o, e.g., 0o644 instead of 0644
* Relative imports
* dict's has_key() no longer exists.  Use 'in' instead.
    d.has_key('key')  =>  'key' in d
* Incompatibility of Python2's and Python3's pickle protocols
* The 'L' suffix for a long integer is no longer needed, e.g., 16L -> 16
* dict.iterkeys() no longer exists; use dict.keys() instead.
* zip() returns an iterator.  Iterating over all elements will effectively
  empty the result.
* Tuple parameter unpacking for lambda is no longer available.  (See
  https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3113/)

  Therefore, something like

    lambda x,y: x+y

  should be replaced by

    lambda x_y: x_y[0] + x_y[1]


Django 1.1 -> 2.0
-----------------
* The method db_type() in a custom field is expected to take a 'connection'
  argument.  E.g.,

    class CodeField(models.Field):
        def db_type(self):
            return 'text'

  is now

    class CodeField(models.Field):
        def db_type(self,connection):
            return 'text'


* The url template tag requires view name to be quoted and prefixed by the
  view's namespace (as specified by the variable app_name in urls.py).  E.g.,

    {% url view-name %}

  is now
  
    {% url 'app:view-name' %}


* 'urlpatterns' in urls.py is expected to be a list of path() or re_path(),
  whose second argument is a view function, not a string.  Basic regex
  patterns are replaced by <type:name> form.  E.g.,

    urlpatterns = patterns(
        'elabsheet.cms.admin_views',
        
        # for downloading solution code
        url(r'^admin/task/(\d+)/solution/', 'get_sol', 
            name='admin-cms-task-get-sol'),
        :
    )

  is now

    from . import admin_views
    app_name = 'cms'
    urlpatterns = [
        # for downloading solution code
        path('admin/task/<int:task_id>/solution/', admin_views.get_sol, 
            name='admin-cms-task-get-sol'),
        :
    ]


* Arguments for the 'cycle' templatetag also need to be quotes.  E.g.,

    <tr class="{% cycle row,row2 %}">

  is now

    <tr class="{% cycle 'row1' 'row2' %}">


* The render_to_response() function has been deprecated.  Use render() instead.

* The django.contrib.markup module has been deprecated.  A custom markdown
  filter has been added in commons/templatetags/markdown_filter.py

* CSRF is enforced.  The tag {% csrf_token %} must be added in every HTML form.

* South has been integrated into Django.  All migrations created by south were
  removed.  To migrate from an existing legacy e-Labsheet database, run:

    ./manage.py migrate --fake-initial

  Notes: all initial migrations in cms, lab, and logger were created using the legacy models.

* The __unicode__ method in each model is no longer used in Python3.  Use
  __str__ instead.

* user.is_authenticated is now a bool, not a function

* User password hash function has changed.

* DateTimeField objects must be timezone-aware.

* Use JsonResponse to response a JSON object instead of using json.dumps()
  manually.

* User messages now become messages app.

    request.user.message_set.create("Your message")

  has to be replaced by

    from django.contrib import messages
    messages.success(request, "Your message")

* MySQL's MyISAM database engine does not support foreign-key constraints.
  All tables should be converted to use InnoDB instead before applying
  migrations.  The script ./convert-innodb.sql has been prepared for
  convenience.
