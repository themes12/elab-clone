E-Labsheet Docker
=================

Docker compose configuration for running E-Labsheet system in Docker.

Usage
-----
To build required Docker images, run the script:

    ./build.sh
    
Start all the containers with:

    docker-compose up -d

Add the following lines into your Nginx's `server` block:

    location = /elab {
        return 302 /elab/;
    }
    location /elab/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8888/;
        proxy_redirect off;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-Elab-Client-IP $remote_addr;
    }

Restart Nginx, then set your browser to `http://<your-host>/elab/`.

Default Django and MySQL usernames and passwords can be found and configured in
the file `docker-compose.yaml`.  In case of MySQL user, the file
`src/elabsheet/elabsheet/settings_local.py`, generated by the `build.sh`
script, must also be changed to match.
